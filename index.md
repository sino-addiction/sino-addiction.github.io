# Welcome to SANI

<!-- TODO: fill in elevator pitch -->
The Sino/Asian Addiction Neuroimaging Initiative (SANI) is a collaborative research effort to understand the neurobiological underpinnings of addiction across diverse populations.

## What is SANI?

<!-- TODO: expand on the SANI initiative -->
SANI brings together researchers from multiple sites to pool and harmonize multimodal neuroimaging data, with a primary focus on EEG. Our goal is to create large-scale datasets to identify robust biomarkers and understand the mechanisms of addiction.

## Why Now?

<!-- TODO: expand on the motivation and timing -->
The field of addiction neuroimaging is at a critical juncture. By creating a harmonized, multimodal dataset, we can address questions that single sites cannot answer alone. SANI aims to accelerate discovery and improve clinical outcomes.
