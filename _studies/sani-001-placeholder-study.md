# Placeholder Study: EEG Biomarkers of Relapse Risk

-   **ID**: SANI-001
-   **Status**: Planning
-   **Contact**: <!-- TODO: Add real contact -->

## Summary

<!-- TODO: Fill in a real summary for a future study. -->
This placeholder study represents the type of project SANI will undertake. It aims to identify robust, EEG-derived biomarkers that can predict the likelihood of relapse in individuals who have undergone treatment for alcohol use disorder.

## Methods

<!-- TODO: Detail the methods for this study. -->
The study will collect resting-state EEG data from participants at multiple time points and use machine learning models to identify predictive features.

## Current Status

<!-- TODO: Update status as the study progresses. -->
The study is currently in the planning and protocol finalization stage.
