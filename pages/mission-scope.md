# Mission & Scope

## Our Mission

<!-- TODO: Refine the mission statement. -->
To accelerate the discovery of neurobiological markers of addiction by creating and analyzing a large-scale, harmonized, multimodal neuroimaging database from Sino and other Asian populations.

## Scope

<!-- TODO: Detail the scope of SANI's work. -->
SANI's primary focus is on the collection, harmonization, and analysis of neuroimaging data, with an emphasis on:

-   **Modalities**: Primarily EEG, with integration of MRI, fMRI, and other relevant data.
-   **Disorders**: All forms of substance and behavioral addiction.
-   **Goals**: Identifying biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response.
-   **Approach**: Collaborative, open-science principles.
