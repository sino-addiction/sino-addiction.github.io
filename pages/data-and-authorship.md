# Data & Authorship Policy

## Data Access

<!-- TODO: Describe the policy and procedure for accessing SANI data. -->
Access to SANI's harmonized datasets is governed by the Data Access Committee (DAC). Applications for data use are reviewed based on scientific merit and adherence to SANI policies. A Data Use Agreement (DUA) must be signed.

## Authorship & Contributorship

<!-- TODO: Detail the authorship policy for SANI-led publications. -->
SANI follows a contributorship model for authorship. All individuals who make a significant contribution to a project will be acknowledged appropriately, with authorship order determined by the scope of contribution.

## Acknowledgment Text

<!-- TODO: Provide the official text for acknowledging SANI in publications. -->
All publications resulting from the use of SANI data must include the following acknowledgment: "This research was supported by the Sino/Asian Addiction Neuroimaging Initiative (SANI). We thank all the participating sites and individuals who contributed to this effort."
