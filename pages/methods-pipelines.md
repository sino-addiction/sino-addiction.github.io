# Methods & Pipelines

<!-- TODO: Provide a detailed overview of the methods and pipelines. -->

## EEG Preprocessing and QC

<!-- TODO: Describe the standardized EEG pipeline. -->
SANI uses a standardized pipeline for EEG data preprocessing and quality control (QC) to ensure consistency across sites.

## Harmonization

<!-- TODO: Explain the approach to data harmonization. -->
We employ advanced statistical methods to harmonize data collected from different scanners and sites, minimizing site-specific variance.

## Analysis Tracks

<!-- TODO: List the primary analysis tracks or projects. -->
-   Track 1: Resting-state EEG connectivity
-   Track 2: Event-related potential (ERP) analysis
-   Track 3: Multimodal EEG-fMRI integration

## Compatibility with ENIGMA Pipelines

<!-- TODO: Explain how SANI pipelines align with ENIGMA. -->
Our pipelines are designed to be compatible with those used by the ENIGMA-Addiction working group, facilitating cross-consortium meta-analyses.
