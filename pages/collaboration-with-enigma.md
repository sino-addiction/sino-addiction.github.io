# Collaboration with ENIGMA-Addiction

SANI and the [ENIGMA-Addiction Working Group](https://enigma.ini.usc.edu/ongoing/enigma-addiction/) are complementary initiatives. While ENIGMA primarily focuses on structural and functional MRI data, SANI's core focus is on EEG and multimodal integration.

## Collaboration Pathways

We actively collaborate with ENIGMA-Addiction to maximize the impact of both consortia.

### Harmonization Compatibility

<!-- TODO: Detail the harmonization compatibility. -->
SANI's data harmonization pipelines are designed to be compatible with ENIGMA's standards, allowing for easier integration of summary statistics and results.

### Joint Meta-Analyses

<!-- TODO: Describe plans for joint meta-analyses. -->
We plan to conduct joint meta-analyses that combine SANI's EEG-derived metrics with ENIGMA's MRI-derived metrics to provide a more comprehensive understanding of addiction.

### Cross-Posting of Calls

<!-- TODO: Mention cross-posting of announcements. -->
Calls for proposals and other significant announcements will be cross-posted between the two initiatives to encourage participation from a wider research community.
