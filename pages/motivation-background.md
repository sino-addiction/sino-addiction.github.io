# Motivation & Background

<!-- TODO: Expand on the scientific and clinical motivation for SANI. -->

The study of addiction neurobiology has been limited by small sample sizes and a lack of diversity in study populations. Most research has been conducted in Western populations, and findings may not generalize to individuals of Asian descent due to genetic and environmental differences.

SANI was created to address these gaps by:
-   **Increasing Statistical Power**: Aggregating data from multiple sites.
-   **Enhancing Generalizability**: Including diverse Sino and Asian populations.
-   **Promoting Multimodal Integration**: Combining EEG, MRI, and other data to create a more complete picture of addiction's effects on the brain.
