# How SANI Works

<!-- TODO: Provide a comprehensive overview of the operational structure. -->

SANI operates as a consortium of collaborating research groups. Our work is structured around several key components:

## Governance Overview

<!-- TODO: Link to the full Governance page. -->
SANI is led by a Steering Committee and organized into several Working Groups (WGs). Key decisions are made collaboratively. For more details, see our [Governance page](./governance.md).

## Working Groups

<!-- TODO: List and briefly describe the main WGs. -->
-   **EEG Pipeline WG**: Develops and maintains EEG analysis pipelines.
-   **MRI Pipeline WG**: Develops and maintains MRI analysis pipelines.
-   **Ethics & Governance WG**: Oversees policies and data access.
-   **Clinical & Phenotype WG**: Harmonizes clinical and behavioral data.

## Calls Cadence

<!-- TODO: Describe the frequency of calls for studies and data. -->
SANI will issue annual calls for new study proposals and data contributions.
