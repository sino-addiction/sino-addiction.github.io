Today marks the official launch of the Sino/Asian Addiction Neuroimaging Initiative (SANI).

<!-- TODO: Expand this news post with more details about the launch. -->

SANI aims to bring together researchers from across the globe to build a harmonized database of EEG, MRI, and other neuroimaging data. By focusing on underrepresented Sino and Asian populations, we hope to accelerate discoveries that are applicable to a wider range of people.

We invite interested researchers to review our [mission](./mission-scope.md) and consider [joining the effort](./join.md).
