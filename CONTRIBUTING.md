## Pull Request (PR) Flow

1.  **Fork the repository**: Create your own copy of the repository.

3.  **Make your changes**: Edit or add files. Ensure you follow the content style guide.
4.  **Test locally**: Run the site locally to ensure your changes look correct and don't introduce any errors.
5.  **Commit your changes**: Write a clear, concise commit message.
6.  **Push to your fork**: Push the changes to your branch on your forked repository.
7.  **Open a Pull Request**: Open a PR from your branch to the `main` branch of the official SANI repository. Provide a clear description of the changes you've made.

## Content Style Guide

-   **Tone**: Maintain a formal, academic, and professional tone.
-   **Language**: Use clear and concise English.
-   **Formatting**: Use standard Markdown. Avoid HTML unless absolutely necessary.
-   **No Emojis**: Do not use emojis in content.
-   **Headings**: Use hash-based headings (`#`, `##`, `###`).
-   **Links**: Use relative links for internal pages (e.g., `../pages/about.md`).
-   **TODOs**: Use HTML comments for notes to editors, like `<!-- TODO: Add citation here. -->`.

## Page Naming Conventions

-   Use lowercase letters.
-   Separate words with hyphens (`-`).
-   Be descriptive (e.g., `motivation-and-background.md` instead of `bg.md`).
-   Files for pages should reside in the `/pages/` directory.
